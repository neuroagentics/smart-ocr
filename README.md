# 🤖 Smart OCR - Agentic AI Document Intelligence

Welcome to **Smart OCR**, an intelligent document processing micro-agent that extracts and classifies text from scanned documents (invoices, receipts, statements, etc.) using a modular AI toolchain.

## 🧠 Overview

Smart OCR is designed as part of a larger **agentic AI architecture** for accounting and data processing. It automatically performs:

- ✅ OCR extraction from images and PDFs
- ✅ Preprocessing and document type classification
- ✅ Vendor categorization and keyword-based tagging
- ✅ Output to CSV or external accounting systems

Built with **Gradio**, this demo offers a visual interface to test the Smart OCR module in isolation.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Upload a document (image or PDF)
2. The app performs:
   - OCR with Tesseract or PaddleOCR
   - Preprocessing (noise reduction, binarization)
   - Optional classification
3. See extracted text and metadata
