# Smart OCR (MVP)

Upload a document (receipt, invoice, etc.). It segments and extracts text using a simulated segmentation pipeline and OCR.

## Usage

1. Upload an image file
2. Click submit
3. Text is extracted and displayed

Runs on Hugging Face Spaces (free tier CPU). Future version will support SAM2 (Metaâ€™s segmentation model) and GPU for better accuracy.
