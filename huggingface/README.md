# ğŸ¤– Smart-OCR: AI-Powered Document Data Extraction Tool

**Smart-OCR** is a modular, lightweight prototype designed to extract meaningful data (e.g., vendor names, payment amounts, handwritten or typed dates) from invoices, receipts, statements, and other business documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technologies. This project is part of the Neuroagentics Toolbelt Suite, focusing on automation and intelligence for modern accounting and business systems.

## ğŸ§  Purpose

This Space is built to:

- Demonstrate OCR extraction from image and PDF documents
- Serve as a foundation for a scalable, agentic data extraction pipeline
- Showcase future integrations with categorization engines, spreadsheet mapping, and financial analysis tools
